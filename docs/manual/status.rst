Project Status
==============

This project is actively maintained and under development. 

- ✅ Core functionality implemented for SLB reservoir simulators.
- ✅ Prototype support for CMG reservoir simulators.
- ✅ Tested with various types of grid systems using benchmark cases:

  - Single-porosity
  - Dual-porosity dual/single-permeability
  - Faulted reservoirs (NNCs)
  - Embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM)
  - Combinations of the above

- 🛠️ Planned improvements:

  - More testing with IX, OPM, and CMG (not yet fully tested)
  - Multidimensional upstream (MDU) weighting - currently uses single-point
    upstream (SPU) weighting.

- 🚀 Looking for contributors! Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
